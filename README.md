# Tic Tac Bro

Tic Tac Bro is a simple single page web application for playing tic tac toe either versus another player locally or versus the Tic Tac Bro, a frat bro inspired AI with three difficulty levels.

## Technology Used

Tic Tac Bro was built using jQuery, JavaScript, Materialize.css, Vivus.js, Scss, and HTML.

### Planning Process

The planning process started out with a concept and a wireframe. I built the first wireframe using Figma, a cloud design tool. The design was heavily influenced by material design apps like Gmail and Slack for android. 

My user stories were:


After finishing my minimum viable product and having a better sense of what I wanted to do with the project, I made a more detailed mockup.


Below is a picture of my minimum viable product, which had only single player functionality.

Most of my day to day planning was done using Trello, where my strategy was adding every todo item I could think of to one of two lists, core functionality and nice to haves. I prioritized core functionality and only did nice to have things if I felt like I had extra time or needed a break from core functionality work.

### Future versions / Unsolved problems

This app is still a work in progress. Unfinished features include:
-   Progressive Web App Functionality
-   Writing tokens to local storage
-   Information page with instructions / faq
-   Custom preloader with a spinning tic tac toe grid
-   Improved desktop styling
-   Refactored code for readability

Unsolved problems include
-   A glitch where AI attempts to take a second turn, only seems to happen 1/100 games so it has been difficult to reproduce/debug.
-   Handling invalidated tokens if a user signs in from a different device.
